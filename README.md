# controllers
A work-in-progress testing platform for controller development and simulation for robotic systems.

# Requirements
We require the following libraries to run the controllers and their simulations:
* [Mujoco](https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco) (at least v2.3.8)

For code generation of kinodynamic quantities of mechanical systems described by a URDF file, we also require the installation of the following:
* [Pinicchio](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/pinocchio)
* [CasADi](https://github.com/casadi/casadi)
