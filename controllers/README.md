# Controller Library

This library is associated with creating controllers for robotic systems.

## Basic Controller Class


## Operational Space Control (OSC) Class

The OSC class is concerned with creating control outputs $u$ that satisfy the dynamics of the system $M \ddot{q} + h = B u + J_c^T \lambda_c$ whilst minimising the error of tracking tasks $x_i(q)$.
